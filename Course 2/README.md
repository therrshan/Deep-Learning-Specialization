## Assignment 1, 2, 3 : 

* These assignments go through three techniques, important for making a model. 
1. Initiaization
2. Regularization
3. Gradient Checking

## Assignment 4 : 

* There are many different optimization algorithms you could be using to get you to the minimal cost. Just like there are many different paths down a hill to the lowest point.
* By completing this assignment you will:

- Understand the intuition between Adam and RMS prop

## Assignment 5 : 

*  You will implement useful functions and draw the parallel with what you did using Numpy. You will understand what Tensors and operations are, as well as how to execute them in a computation graph.
* By completing this assignment you will:

- using our brand new SIGNS dataset, you will build a deep neural network model to recognize numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language with a pretty impressive accuracy.
