## Assignment 1 : 

* In this assignment you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!
* As you keep learning new techniques you will increase it to 80+ % accuracy on cat vs. non-cat datasets. By completing this assignment you will:

- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.
- Learn how to minimize the cost function.
- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.

## Assignment 2 : 

* In this assignment you will generate red and blue points to form a flower. You will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. You will try different layers and see the results.

* By completing this assignment you will:

- Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.
- Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.
- Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.

The gifs show the good and bad behaviour of the gradient descent curves fit to the models.

## Assignment 3 : 

* In this assignment you will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks in the next assignment to build a neural network of any architecture you want.
* By completing this assignment you will:

- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.
- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.
- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.

## Assignment 4 : 

* In this assignment you will use everything you have learned to build a deep neural network that classifies cat vs. non-cat images.
* In the second experiment, you used logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy. Your algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy! 
* By completing this assignment, you will:

- Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.
- Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.
- Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
